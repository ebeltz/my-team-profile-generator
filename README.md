# My Team Profile Generator

## Team Profile Generator
This Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that takes information from users and generates a team profile with their employee IDs, github username, email address, school, role, and name. The generator takes that information that user inputs to generate an HTML webpage that displays all the information that was given.
